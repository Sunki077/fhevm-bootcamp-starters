# HW4: Capstone Project

This is it! Time to take the training wheels off. You will design and build a confidential application from scratch.

## 🎯 Objective

Choose **one** of the following paths or propose your own:

1. **Confidential DAO:** A voting system where the tally is encrypted until the vote ends.
2. **Private AMM:** A basic swap where the trade amounts are hidden.
3. **Encrypted Game:** A "Battleship" or "Rock Paper Scissors" style game where moves are secret.

## 📋 Requirements

* Must use at least three different `TFHE` operations (e.g., `add`, `select`, `gt`, `reencrypt`).
* Must include a comprehensive test suite in `test/`.
* The `README.md` in this folder must be updated to explain your project's logic.

## 🚀 Submission

1. Ensure all code is commented.
2. Verify all tests pass.
3. Push your final changes to your repository.
